After days of toil and constant insecurity, You see an outline of small village in the distance.
The sun has set some time ago and you notice warm light of fireplaces in few houses.
Suddenly you realise that you're quite cold and exhausted. The village tempts you with promise of relative safety and warmth, but you're alredy on borrowed time.
It's time to decide
Do you take the path to the left, leading to the village
Or do you go to the right and continue through the wilderness?
